# Upgrading shell to fully-interactive TTY

Upgrading half shells to fully interactive TTYs
This document is how-to guide to upgrade your target machine’s netcat reverse shell to a fully
interactive TTY, that will allow things like auto-complete, command history, and Ctrl-C. Here’s the
steps:
- Once you’ve got your desired reverse shell go ahead and spawn bash using PTY

python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

- Now background your reverse shell using Ctrl-Z

- While the shell is in the background examine the current terminal $TERM and stty configuration:

root@kali:~# echo $TERM
xterm-256color
root@kali:~# stty -a
speed 38400 baud; rows 55; columns 205; line = 0;
intr = ^C; quit = ^\; erase = ^?; kill = ^U; eof = ^D; eol = <undef>; eol2
= <undef>; swtch = <undef>; start = ^Q; stop = ^S; susp = ^Z; rprnt = ^R;
werase = ^W; lnext = ^V; discard = ^O; min = 1; time = 0;
-parenb -parodd -cmspar cs8 -hupcl -cstopb cread -clocal -crtscts

ff0
isig icanon iexten echo echoe echok -echonl -noflsh -xcase -tostop -echoprt
echoctl echoke -flusho -extproc

root@kali:~#
The information needed is the TERM type ("xterm-256color") and the size of the current TTY ("rows 38;
columns 116")
- With the shell still in the background set the current STTY to type raw and tell it to echo the
input characters with the following command:

stty raw -echo

- Next foreground the shell with fg. It will re-open the reverse shell but formatting will be off.
Finally, reinitialize the terminal with reset. Note: I did not type the nc command again (as it
@ihack4falafel 2
might look above). I actually entered fg, but it was not echoed. The nc command is the job that
is now in the foreground. The reset command was then entered into the netcat shell
- After reset the shell should look normal again. The last step is to set the shell, terminal type and
stty size to match our current Kali window (from the info gathered earlier)

$ export SHELL=bash
$ export TERM=xterm256-color
$ stty rows 38 columns 116

The end result is a fully interactive TTY with all the features we'd expect (tab-complete, history, job
control, etc) all over a netcat connection.
