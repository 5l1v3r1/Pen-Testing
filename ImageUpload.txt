# Ways to fool jpeg/png uploads

1. Simply try to add the same extension .png or %00.png or pHP or pHp or PHP or php3 etc.
2. Load up BurpSuite

- rename file to malicious.php.png or .jpeg
- Click upload file and intercept the request
- Before forwarding remove the .png or .jpg and forward it
- We just uploaded .php and we run it!

3. Content-Type file upload

- Upload a normal php file
- Intercept it with BurpSuite and under 'Content-Type' change from application/php etc. to image/png
- Navigate to it and run it

4. Null byte Injection

- Upload mal.php.jpg file and Intercept
- Now where in "RAW" it says mal.php.jpg replace with mal.phpD.jpg
- Go into "HEX" tab and look for this 'D' we just added and look at its HEX which will be '44'
- Replace this with 00 and forward the packet.
- Succesfully uploaded the php File
