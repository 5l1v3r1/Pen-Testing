# HTTP Parameter pollution

## What is it?
Server-side HPP and Client Side HPP
Server side - take parameters and see what the server side code is doing with them. Experiment with values, use same parameters twice etc.
Client side - Inject parameters in a URL and it is reflected back to the user.

Be on the lookout for opportunities when websites accept content and appear
to be contacting another web service, like social media sites, and relying on the
current URL to generate the link to create a shared post.
In these situations, it may be possible that submitted content is being passed
on without undergoing proper security checks, which could lead to parameter
pollution vulnerabilities.

Always look for parameter tampering, use multiple parameters and see results.
