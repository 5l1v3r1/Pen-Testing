1. Exactly like Unquoted service path but instead of dropping our executable anywhere on the path
this is way more focused on just one of the locations.

icacls "C:\Program Files\Program Folder"

In unquoted service path we can put the malicious exe anyewhere on the path like C:\mal.exe or C:\Program Files\mal.exe and so on

However, in this method its only a fixed folder C:\Program Files\A folder\ which we have write access to replace an executable
and restart the service will do it for us.
