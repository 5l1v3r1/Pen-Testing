# Privilege Escalation using the PATH variable
Basically every command is executed from /bin or /sbin like /bin/cp etc.
In this method we basically change the path of a process by replacing the service
it is calling into something malicious.

1. echo $PATH

2. We find that there is a script running as root and it calls 'ps' command
in /scripts/ABCD

3. We create a malicious binary called 'ps' under /tmp

4. Now we change the PATH variable to /tmp/

5. Now when we run ./ABCD it will run ps as /tmp/ps and we will have our reverse shell.
